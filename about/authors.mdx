## Project Background

Guardian API evolved from an academic machine learning project focused on detecting sexism in social media text. What started as a binary classification problem for a CSC 380 class project has grown into a comprehensive, production-ready content moderation system.

### Academic Foundation (Fall 2025)

**Course**: CSC 380 - Machine Learning
**Institution**: University of Arizona
**Original Goal**: Build a sexism classifier using LASSO regression

**Initial Scope**:
- Train binary classifier on ~40,000 labeled tweets
- Achieve >80% F1 score
- Demonstrate practical ML engineering

### Evolution to Production

After successfully completing the academic requirements, I chose to expand the project into a full-fledged API service:

**Phase 1**: Multi-Model Architecture
- Added toxicity transformer model
- Integrated rule-based heuristics
- Designed ensemble aggregation system

**Phase 2**: Production Infrastructure
- Built FastAPI backend
- Implemented rate limiting and caching
- Added comprehensive error handling and logging

**Phase 3**: Developer Experience
- Created Python and JavaScript SDKs
- Generated comprehensive documentation
- Set up interactive API playground

**Phase 4**: Advanced Features
- GPU acceleration support
- Batch processing capabilities
- Custom deployment options

## Philosophy

Guardian API is built on several core principles:

  <Accordion title="Transparency" icon="eye">
    **Open Source & Explainable**

    - Full source code available on GitHub
    - Clear model explanations
    - Documented decision-making process
    - No black-box algorithms
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Accuracy" icon="bullseye">
    **Multi-Model Validation**

    - Never rely on a single model
    - Ensemble voting reduces false positives
    - Continuous evaluation and improvement
    - Academic rigor meets production standards

- **Pydantic**: Data validation and settings management

### Models
- **Custom LASSO**: Binary sexism classifier
- **HuggingFace Transformers**: Pre-trained toxicity detection
- **NLTK**: Natural language preprocessing
- **Custom Rules**: Regex-based pattern matching

### Infrastructure
- **Uvicorn**: ASGI server
- **Redis/Upstash**: Rate limiting and caching
- **Docker**: Containerization
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD (planned)

### SDKs
- **Python**: Type hints, async support
- **TypeScript**: Full type definitions
- **Requests/Fetch**: HTTP clients
